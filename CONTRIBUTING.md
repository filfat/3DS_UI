# Contributing to Prepack
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
The GitHub repository is the source of truth for us and all development takes place here.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests. If you are planning on doing a larger chunk of work, make sure to file an issue first to get feedback on your idea.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes, your code lints and typechecks. Your pull request might not get the attention it deserves if it fails in our automated continuous integration system.
5. Consider quashing your commits (`git rebase -i`). One intent alongside one commit makes it clearer for people to review and easier to understand your intention.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Coding Style
*Most important: Look around.* Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming things in code, naming things in documentation.

## License
By contributing to Prepack, you agree that your contributions will be licensed
under the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
